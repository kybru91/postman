<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/TheThirdOne/everything-sloths/master/svg/mail.svg" width="130" alt="Postman Icon" align="right">
Postman is a CLI utility for batch-sending email through any SMTP server (so you can use Postman with your personal Gmail, Amazon SES, Sendgrid, or anything else you'd like).

#### Features

* Fast, templated, bulk emails
* Reads template attributes from CSV
* Works with any SMTP server

##### Why this over `cat | sed | sendmail < bcc distro_list`?

* Supports both text and HTML parts in emails
* All of the power of templates in Go (conditionals, etc)
* Some SMTP providers will complain if there are too many emails in BCC
  (generally >1000)
* Sends emails concurrently
